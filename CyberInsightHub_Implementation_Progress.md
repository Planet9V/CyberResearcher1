# CyberInsight Hub Implementation Progress

## Project Overview
CyberInsight Hub is a comprehensive platform for analyzing, enriching, and extracting intelligence from cybersecurity reports. The system processes various document formats, extracts key insights, and provides an interactive interface for security professionals to explore and utilize this intelligence.

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: React Version Compatibility
**Issue**: Next.js 14.x requires React 18.x, but we installed React 19.0.0
**Solution**: Need to downgrade React to version 18.2.0 to ensure compatibility with Next.js

### Challenge: Three.js Performance
**Issue**: Rendering many particles and connections can impact performance
**Solution**: Implemented optimized rendering with:
- Instanced mesh rendering
- Frustum culling
- Limited connection visibility

## Next Steps
1. Fix dependency version conflicts
2. Complete document upload component
3. Set up Supabase storage and authentication
4. Begin implementing the document processing pipeline
