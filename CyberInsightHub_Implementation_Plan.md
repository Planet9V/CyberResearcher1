## Critical Success Factors

- **Document Processing Accuracy** - The system's core value depends on accurate extraction and processing
- **Search Relevance** - User adoption requires high-quality search results
- **LLM Integration Quality** - Chat functionality must provide valuable insights, not just regurgitate text
- **Performance at Scale** - System must maintain performance with hundreds of reports
- **User Experience** - Interface must be intuitive and efficient for cybersecurity professionals

## Implementation Strategy for Maximum Efficiency

### 1. Parallel Development Streams

The implementation plan allows for three parallel development workstreams:

- **Backend Services Stream** - Focus on implementing the database, document processing, and API layer
- **Frontend Development Stream** - Build the UI components and pages
- **Integration Stream** - Connect frontend and backend, implement testing, and polish the application

### 2. Common Component Development

The following components should be prioritized as they form the foundation for multiple aspects of the system:

- **Document Processing Pipeline** - Critical for all data ingestion and serves as foundation for many other components
- **Vector Embedding Service** - Required for both search and LLM context building
- **Design System & Component Library** - Forms the basis for all frontend components
- **Authentication System** - Required for both frontend and backend security

### 3. Risk Mitigation for High-Complexity Tasks

For high-complexity tasks (rated 4-5), implement the following strategy:

- **Build Simplified Versions First** - Create functional but limited implementations to validate approach
- **Incremental Enhancement** - Add features in small, testable increments
- **Early Integration Testing** - Test high-risk components with dependent systems early to identify issues
- **Plan for Rewrites** - Allow time for potential partial rewrites of high-complexity components

## Developer Onboarding Notes

For each completed task, document the following for new developers:

1. **Purpose and Functionality** - What does this component do and why does it exist?
2. **Architecture and Design** - How is it structured and what design patterns are used?
3. **Dependencies** - What other components does it rely on?
4. **Usage Examples** - How should other parts of the system interact with this component?
5. **Testing Approach** - How can this component be tested?
6. **Known Limitations** - What are the current constraints or limitations?
7. **Future Improvements** - What enhancements are planned or recommended?
