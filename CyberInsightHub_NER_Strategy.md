   - Calculate confidence scores for matches

4. **Attribute Merging**
   - Combine Diffbot attributes with our extracted data
   - Resolve conflicts with confidence-based voting
   - Maintain provenance for all attributes

### Diffbot Entity Types Mapping

| Our Entity Type | Diffbot Entity Type | Enrichment Target |
|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------|
